      <p>What do participants say about their time with us?</p><br>

      <p style="font-style:italic">I got a lot more confident in my ability to say and do things…to get a job done, roll up my sleeves and do it…SOL Garden is unbelievable and tremendously important. It pretty much carved out the life I have right now… There were people at SOL Garden who actually cared about what I had to say. Shawn.</p><br>

      <p style="font-style:italic;">Coming here is the best decision I ever made. Jen</p></br>

      <p>SOL Garden is free to local youth, and made possible through grants from the MA Cultural Council Youth Reach Program, The AT and T Aspire Program, The Green Leaf Foundation, and individual contributions.</p>
